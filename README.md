# FIDO UAF (Universal Authentication Framework) client for Android

You can use the FIDO UAF client to authenticate logging in to Android apps without a password.

Use it to:

* register biometric details, such as fingerprint
* authorise against registered biometric details

## Requirements

* Android Marshmallow or above
* Minimum SDK 21, target SDK 27 and above

## Installation

To use the client in your own application, you need to add a Maven reference to your build configuration.

Releases can be found on [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central), or see the instructions below for makng changes and generating your own artifacts locally.

### Generating Maven artifacts

To generate a new set of Maven artifacts once you have made a code change:

1. Update the build version in `fidoclient/build.gradle`

    ```groovy
    ext.build_version = '1.0.3-SNAPSHOT'
    ```
    Ensure to remove the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix for publishing to the releases repository.

2. Build and publish the artifacts to the local Maven repository:

    ```console
    $ ./gradlew clean build publishAllPublicationsToLocalMavenRepository
    ```

3. There are separate local repositories configured for snapshot and release builds. Reference the local snapshot Maven repository in your Android project.

    ```groovy
    allprojects {
      repositories {
        maven {
          "file:./path/to/nhsapp-fido-client-android/fidoclient/build/maven/snapshots"
        }
      }
    }

    dependencies {
      implementation 'io.github.nhsconnect:fido-uaf-client-android:1.0.3-SNAPSHOT'
    }
    ```

### Error handling

The client throws the following errors:

```java
FidoAssertionException
FidoInvalidSignatureException
GenericFidoException
```
